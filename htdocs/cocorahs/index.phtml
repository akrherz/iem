<h3>Community Collaborative Rain, Hail, and Snow Network</h3>

<p><a href="https://cocorahs.org">CoCoRaHS</a> is a nationwide effort to collect
    observations of rain, hail, and snowfall.  This network is a lot like the
    <a href="/COOP/">NWS Cooperative Observer (COOP)</a> network, but is not
    as official.  The IEM collects the daily reports from this network and
    offers a few tools for the dataset.</p>
