<h3>Iowa Atmospheric Observatory</h3>

<section id="overview">
<h3>Overview</h3>
</section>

<p>The Iowa Atmospheric Observatory (IAO) was designed and constructed by 
Iowa State University under funding from the Iowa Power Fund and National Science Foundation 
Iowa EPSCoR grant (Grant # 1101284).  This distributed observing facility 
is anchored by its two tall (120-m) towers, separated by 22 km, operating 
continuously since June 2016 in central Iowa.  Tower A1 is located within 
a 200-turbine utility-scale wind farm, and Tower A2 is located in similar 
terrain and landscape but outside the same wind farm.  Collocated at tower A2 
since May 1, 2018, is a sodar wind profiler unit. In addition to the sodar, 
a surface meteorological station was also added to the A2 site on 
November 29, 2018. Various guest/collaboration sensors have been 
located at the sites as well. Associated short-term 
field research and teaching activities and their associated field observing 
facilities are deployed for specific short term intensive observing periods 
(IOPs) or longer term studies.  Remote sensing instruments also have been 
and will be deployed for IOPs and continuously as new projects develop.</p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">

<p>The agricultural landscape surrounding each tower is blocked out in 
one-mile (1.6 km) squares defined by public roads.  The terrain is relatively 
flat (with elevation changes of about +/- 3 m per square mile), and the land-use 
is predominantly (~90%) intensely managed row crops, either corn 
(mature height 1.5-2.0 m) or soybeans (1.0 m) during the growing season.  
A few farmsteads of area of ~1 hectare (2-3 acres) dot the landscape 
(~1-2 per square mile) consisting of a few 1-2 story buildings surrounded by 
trees typically of height 5-10 m.  Crops are planted in April-May and 
harvested in September-October.  Outside this growing season the landscape 
is bare with some crop residue giving surface roughness elements 
(not z<sub>o</sub>) of ~ 5-8 cm.  The A1 Tower has grass (height ~0.2-0.8 m) in the 
immediate vicinity (1 hectare) of the tower. A visible aerial image of the 
agricultural landscape surrounding the A2 Tower (Figure 1) reveals the 
homogeneity of surface. The tower is located on a rectangular 
crushed-rock area in the center of the image that is 
connected by a crushed-rock private road to a grid of public roads.  
The east-west roads at the top and bottom of the image are 1 mile apart.</p>

<h3>Instruments</h3>
</section>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">

<p>The two 120-m towers host identical profiles of instruments at levels of 
5, 10, 20, 40, 80, and 120 m as shown in Figure 2.  The towers are of a 
triangular lattice construction approximately 1 m on a side.  Details of 
the instruments are listed in Table 1, and boom orientations and lengths, 
identical on both towers, are shown in Figure 3.  Photos of the instruments 
and booms on the towers are shown in Figures 4a and 4b. Redundant wind 
speed and direction sensors at each level provide measurements with 
minimal tower interference for flow from prevailing wind directions at 
these sites, which are shown by the 10-m (Figure 5a) and 80-m (Figure 5b) 
wind roses from Tower A2.  Orientation of booms and sensor locations 
along each boom are shown in Figure 5.   
Site photos (Figure 6) show the climate-controlled concrete sheds 
housing data acquisition and communication facilities at the base of 
each tower and the proximity of the A1 tower to nearby rows of turbines.</p>

<h3>Topography and Tower Mast Influences on IAO Measurements</h3>
</section>

<p>Terrain for both sites is flat with about 13m higher elevation at A2 vs. 
A1 (356.6 m vs. 343.8 m). Within 1 km of A1 the land slopes gently upward 
(≤1.0%) to the south, southwest, west, northwest, and north of the tower. 
Surrounding A2 slopes within 1 km of the tower are ±0.1% to the south, 
southwest, west, and northwest of the tower and -0.3% to the north of the 
tower. Both sites feature slopes that vary radially away from the tower at 
rates of less than ±0.7% within a 4-km distance of each tower for each of 
the following directions [A1 vs A2] S: -0.3% vs. -0.2%; W: <-0.1% vs. -0.2%.; 
N: <0.1% vs. 0%; E: <0.1% vs. <0.1%. These topographical variations are 
significantly lower than the requirements for site calibration of met 
towers near wind turbines (e.g. <10% slope or height variations of ±4m 
from the horizontal plane at a distance of 16 rotor diameters, D (D=82m) 
from a turbine (IEC61400-12:1, 2005)).</p>

<p>Influence of tower cross section on our measurements is shown in Figure 7 
by taking the ratio of median wind speeds from the WNW and S IAO Tower 
booms for 80-m wind direction from the A2 reference tower.  From wind 
directions approximately S (172.5°) to approximately NW (326.5°) we 
expect less than 5% variation in anemometer speeds due to the tower 
influence.  For easterly and northerly wind, the WNW and S anemometer 
speeds depart by 30-40% depending on the leeward or windward position of
each anemometer.  Higher variability 
of the normalized speed is indicated at the 10-m and 120-m levels due to 
cup anemometer malfunction on the south boom before instrument repair in 
August 2016.  We also observe a slight reduction in the tower wake at 5-m 
for easterly wind which we attribute to the flow interference from the 
2.5-m tall equipment shed.  At 20 m and above the tower shadow is the 
dominant influence on the waked region.</p>

<h3>Remote sensors and surface met station</h3>
</section>

<p>Measurements from wind profiling systems complement understanding of 
low-level stability and turbulence measurements from the tall towers. 
A sodar was installed 140 m northeast of A2 May 1, 2018 (Figures 8a and 8b). 
A lidar was also positioned near the base of the A2 tower in May 2018. 
Horizontal and vertical wind speed, wind direction, turbulence intensity, 
and data quality are monitored at ten heights from 40 m to 200 m every ten 
minutes from both the lidar and sodar.</p>

<p>A hyperspectral and infrared camera were installed on the A2 tower at 80 m 
during the 2018 growing season to monitor field-scale variations in 
crop water use and plant photosynthetic activity. A surface met station 
(Figure 9) was installed 10 m southwest of the A2 tower base in September 
2018 and consists of a tripod mast with sensors for 2 m air temperature and 
relative humidity, 2 m wind speed and wind direction, 2 m pressure, 
incoming solar radiation, and precipitation.</p>

<section id="data">
<h3>Tower Data</h3>
</section>

<p>Two continuous data streams from the towers operate at different sampling 
rates.  Temperature, relative humidity, horizontal wind speed, wind 
direction, and pressure are reported and archived a 1-Hz, while 
3-component wind speed and virtual temperature are reported at 
20-Hz by sonic anemometers.   Archives of the continuous record of the 
1-Hz data began in June 2016.  Data were recorded episodically from the 
sonic anemometers starting November 2016.</p>

<p>One-minute average plots from select data streams for last 36 hours are available at:

<h3>Crop/Wind-energy Experiment (CWEX)</h3>
</section>

<p>A series of field experiments was conducted in advance of construction of 
the tall towers from 2009-2013 in the vicinity of the tower locations taking 
advantage of their proximity to a 200-turbine utility-scale wind farm.  
More details of the field sites, observing facilities, data archives and 
scientific results can be found in the publications and presentations 
listed below.</p>
