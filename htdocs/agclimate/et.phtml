<h3>Evapotranspiration Details</h3>

<p>Evapotranspiration (ET) is a term that describes the transport of water from
	the ground surface and soil to the atmosphere.  This includes processes like
	evaporation of liquid water and transpiration done by vegetation.  It is
	an important part of the Water Cycle and knowing the amount of ET happening
	during the growing season is important for usage in modelling, irrigation,
	and crop management.</p>

<h4>So lets 'observe' ET!</h4>
		
<p>Directly measuring ET is not practical as you would have to somehow account
	for every molecule of water vapor and know its exact source to know if it
	contributed to the local ET.  The most common approach to directly
	measuring ET is very expensive as it involves tracking air flow and
	moisture in 3 dimensions. Another approach is through the usage of a
	lysimeters, which attempt to keep an accounting of soil water.</p>

<p>So when all else fails, we can produce model estimates based on more
	commonly collected data.  That is what the legacy ISU AgClimate Network
	and now ISU Soil Moisture Network has done.  This page attempts to fully
	document the equations used and the application caveats of the data.</p>

<h3>Estimating Evapotranspiration</h3>

<div class="alert alert-info">The estimation techniques described should apply
		for both the legacy ISU AgClimate Network and the current ISU Soil
		Moisture Network.</div>

<p>Hourly estimates of ET are made by a set of equations found on the Campbell
		Scientific Data Logger.  These hourly values are then summed to produce
		calendar day totals to avoid confusion with having slightly conflicting
		ET values for a given day.</p>

<p>The hourly ET is estimated by the <a href="http://www.kimberly.uidaho.edu/water/asceewri/ASCE_Standardized_Ref_ET_Eqn_Phoenix2000.pdf">ASCE Standardized Reference Evapotranspiration Equation</a>
		, which assumes a reference tall crop (alfalfa).  The equation is as follows,
		taken from the aforementioned reference.
