<h3>IEM Provided JSON-P Webservices</h3>

<p>This page is an attempt to document the various JSON-P web services the
 IEM uses to drive its various applications.  These services are provided without
 warranty and may be disabled without warning if "bad things happen". We do
 try our best to keep them running, so please <a href="/info/contacts.php">Contact Us</a>
 if you have difficulties.
 
 <p>These services support <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP">JSONP</a>,
 which is a technique that allows the deliver of data from a cross-domain origin.
 The technique involves placing or injecting &lt;script&gt; tags into your webpage
 and specifying a javascript function to callback.  For example,
 <br /><pre>
 &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  function gotData(data){
     console.log(data);
  }
 &lt;/script&gt;
 &lt;script type="text/javascript"
         src="https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/json/example.php?callback=gotData"&gt;
 
 </pre>
 
 <p>This &lt;script&gt; tag above that requests data from this server will return
 javascript that looks like:
 <br /><pre>
 gotData({"Name": "daryl", "Profession": "nerd", "Age": 99});
 </pre>

<h3>But first, perhaps there are better alternatives</h3>

<p>The following is a list of other web service providers.  They all do a better
job than this website does.  Some of these are commercial and this listing should
not be implied as an endorsement. Of course, you can just search google for
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=weather+api">Weather API</a> :)</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.aerisweather.com/develop/">Aeris Weather</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://cs-docs.dtn.com/apis/">DTN</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://realearth.ssec.wisc.edu/doc/api.php">SSEC RealEarth API</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/">Wunderground API</a></li>
</ul>

 <p>Okay, so you are all set for documentation on what services are available!
{$table}
 
 <p>That is all for now. Enjoy!
