</ol>

<p>The IEM server resides in a room that is climate controlled by a 
dedicated heat exchanger.  This page presents daily plots of logged 
temperatures.  There are four one-wire sensors measuring ambient temperature.
The arrangement of these sensors has changed over the years. 
The current temperature observation points are:
<ul>
 <li><b>In Air Handler:</b> Located at 5 feet above the floor at the 
intake of the heat exchanger.</li>
 <li><b>Out Air Handler:</b> Located below the sub floor where the
cooled air departs the heat exchanger.</li>
 <li><b>In Rack:</b> Located on the front door of the rack at about 1 meter
 height.</li>
 <li><b>Out Rack:</b> Located at the back of the rack at about 1 meter
 height.</li>
</ul>

<br>Note that the archive begins 24 Jul 2003.</p>
