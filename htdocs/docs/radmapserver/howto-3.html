<P>Probably the easiest component of this HOWTO is building the composite 
image within GEMPAK!  If you are running a version of GEMPAK before 5.6.j, you
will need to download and install the nex2img program.  If you already have
nex2img, then you can skip the next subsection.</P>
<P>GEMPAK is publicly available from the 
<A HREF="http://my.unidata.ucar.edu/content/software/gempak/index.html">UNIDATA website</A>.  Installing GEMPAK 
is way outside the scope of this HOWTO.</P>
<P>Nex2img was written by Steve Chiswell at the UNIDATA Program Center.  His 
program is the key to making this whole system work.  Before nex2img, it was
extremely tricky to get the geo-referencing of RASTERs, produced in GEMPAK, correct for use 
within GIS.</P>

<P>Building nex2img is very straightforward with GEMPAK already installed.

<P>With the nex2img program built, you are now ready to generate the composites.</P>

</H2>

<P>This simple script will crank out an image.  I am specifying a GRDAREA for
Iowa and extended. You will want to modify for your own needs.  Keep in mind
that this application composites individual site NEXRADs,  you can't build a nationwide 
composite without having all the individual sites.

<P>The nex2img program will generate an image called "radar.gif".  In order to 
work with most GIS systems, you will probably want to convert this file
to another format namely TIFF, but you can choose JPG or PNG.  We then place
the radar.tif file in the webserver directory for later use by mapserver.</P>
<P>Without getting too long winded, lets discuss image formats.  The easiest 
format for use within GIS is probably TIFF.  Although very large, uncompressed
tiff files are extremely fast within GIS.  The reason is that the application 
can "seek" the file to only pull needed data.  With compressed formats, an
entire set of data needs to be uncompressed and then processed.  Also, most 
people will probably try loading the image in ESRI's ArcView.  ArcView likes
TIFF files and has built in support for them.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="howto.html#toc3.3">Geo-referencing the composite image</A>
</H2>

<P>Now that we have an image, we need to georeference it.  Georeferencing of 
images is done with a world file.  A world file is simply a file with 6 lines
of meta data describing the navigation of an image.  The format is for 
example:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
0.010 (size of pixel in x direction)
0.000000000000 (rotation term for row) *Typically zero
0.000000000000 (rotation term for column) *Typically zero
-0.010 (size of pixel in y direction)
-95.0000 (x coordinate of centre of upper left pixel in map units)
42.300 (y coordinate of centre of upper left pixel in map units) 
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Note that the units of the geo-referencing are in the same units of the
projection.  Since we are in lat-lon space, the units are decimal degrees.
If you were in UTM space, it would probably be meters.
For the image generated from my example of nex2img, my world file 
would look like
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
   0.01000
   0.00000
   0.00000
  -0.01000
-104.00000
  49.00000

<H3>Naming the world file</H3>

<P>Depending on your GIS, the naming convention of your world file may be 
different.  Many systems use a generic <I>.wld</I> to describe any world 
file.  Others use variants on the image format nomenclature, for instance, the world file
for TIF formated files is <I>.tfw</I> and for PNG is <I>.pngw</I>. For our
purposes, we will use <I>.wld</I>.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.4">3.4</A> <A HREF="howto.html#toc3.4">Lets pause for a second</A>
</H2>

<P>If you have made it this far, you are probably wondering what to do with the
RASTER image with no political borders or other denotations and this silly
6 line world file.  The next section shows an example of taking this image
and using the powerful Mapserver to produce a Web Map application.  Trust me, 
this is not the only application of this data.</P>
