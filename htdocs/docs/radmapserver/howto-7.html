<P>This HOWTO demonstrated a very primitive component of GIS, web mapping.  There
is just so much more that can be done.  For those of you familiar with PHP, 
Mapserver has an outstanding PHP interface to the Mapserver API.  You can 
create some of the neatest applications using the Mapserver API and the power
of PHP.  The Iowa Environmental Mesonet has implemented most of its Mapserver
interfaces using the PHP mapscript module.  The source code for these applications is licensed under the GPL, but I just don't place the code on the website to download.  Just
email me if you would like a copy...</P>

<P>I would suspect that most people will not have the ability to generate nationwide NEXRAD composites.  One of the neat things Mapserver can do is act as a 
Web Map Service (WMS) server and client.  Potentially a WMS server could be
set up somewhere on the Internet and then your mapserver could make a remote
WMS call to it get the image.</P>
<P>Another option, will be for either UNIDATA, the IEM, or somebody else to generate the nationwide composite (in 'unprojected' coordinates) and make that available on the IDD.  This is probably
the easiest way to get this data to the community. </P>
<P>Although never covered in this HOWTO, timestamps are a big issue with this 
system.  I have built hacks using DBF files in order to get timestamps on the 
generated images.  Here is an example of output using this 'hack'.  At some 
point, I will add this hack to the HOWTO.
