<h3>2003 AMS Presentation Notes</h3>

		<div class="alert alert-danger">Sorry, some of the links on this page are no
		longer functioning.</div>
		
<p>On 11 Feb 2003, the IEM presented a paper at the 83rd AMS
Annual Meeting in Long Beach California.  This page contains links to the
<a href="/present/030211_ams/">presentation</a> and URLS for applications referenced in the talk.</p>


<p><b><a href="/GIS/apps/coop/">Example 1</a>
Climatological Data</b>
<br>Interactive climate plots are generated from a climate spatial database.  
You can download data you see presented in GIS format.</p>

<p><b>Example 2 IEM Real-time Precipitation Analysis (discontinued)</b>
<br>Current rainfall observations are combined with NEXRAD precip imagery to
create this dynamic plotting application.  Data is immediately available to
download from this app.</p>

<p><b><a href="GIS/apps/pcs/">Example 3</a> Archived NEXRAD vs ASOS/AWOS precipitation comparisons</b>
<br>This application allows dynamic comparisons between historical hourly rainfall
estimates from the NEXRAD and observations from the AWOS/ASOS.  Eventually, this 
application will work in real-time and archived mode and with other networks.</p>

<p><b><a href="/sites/locate.php">Example 4</a> IEM Site Location Maps</b>
<br>This slick application combines topography, photography and other layers
with an IEM site location to produce a zoomable plot of a site's location. The
maps are <b>fascinating</b> to look at.  Once you follow the link, you will
want to select a station and then "Location Maps".</p>

<p><b><a href="/GIS/apps/plotter/currents.php">Example 5</a>
Dynamic Data Plotter</b>
<br>Utilizing GIS data and the power of PHP, dynamic images are generated from
user selections of stations and data variable.</p>

<p>All of these applications are open-source and available for your use.  Please
send Daryl (akrherz@iastate.edu) an email if you are interested in any of these apps.
