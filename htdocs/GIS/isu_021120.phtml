<h3>Iowa State GIS Day</h3>

<div class="alert alert-danger">Sorry, some of the links on this page are no
		longer functioning.</div>
		
<p>On 20 Nov 2002, the IEM was privileged to be invitied as the
keynote speaker for the <a href="http://www.gis.iastate.edu/gisday02/home.htm">Iowa State GIS Day</a>.
  This page provides a link to the 
<a href="/present/021120_isugis/">presentation</a> and URLS for applications referenced in the talk.</p>


<p><b>>Example 1. Precipitation Analysis (discontinued)</b>
<br>Web mapping application that combines NEXRAD precipitation estimates with
observations in near real-time.</p>

<p><b><a href="/cgi-bin/mapserv/mapserv?map=/opt/iem/htdocs/GIS/apps/iatorn/iatorn.map">Example 2</a>  Iowa Tornado Database</b>
<br>Based on an Iowa Tornado reports archive, this web application allows you
the ability to dynamically plot and query tornado reports.</p>

<p><b>Example 3 NWS Archive Warnings with National Composite NEXRAD</b>
<br>NWS severe bulletins are ingested into the IEM spatial database in real-time
and combined with a recent national RADAR mosiac.</p>

<p><b>Example 4 3-4 June 2002 Flooding (discontinued)</b>
<br>This application was quickly produced last summer in response to flooding in Eastern Iowa on
the dates of 3-4 June 2002.</p>

<p><b><a href="/my/current.php">Example 5</a> Dynamic Variable Plotting</b>
<br>With the IEM Currents page, you can dynamically select stations you would 
like to plot and the variable of your choice.  The link may take you to a blank
page, if so, you will want to select a data network and add stations to your
favorites list.</p>

<p><b><a href="/GIS/apps/pcs/">Example 6</a> Archived NEXRAD vs ASOS/AWOS precipitation comparisons</b>
<br>This application allows dynamic comparisons between historical hourly rainfall
estimates from the NEXRAD and observations from the AWOS/ASOS.  Eventually, this 
application will work in real-time and archived mode and with other networks.</p>

<p><b><a href="/sites/locate.php">Example 7</a> IEM Site Location Maps</b>
<br>This slick application combines topography, photography and other layers
with an IEM site location to produce a zoomable plot of a site's location. The
maps are <b>fascinating</b> to look at.  Once you follow the link, you will
want to select a station and then "Location Maps".</p>
