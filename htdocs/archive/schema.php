<h3>Archived Data Schema</h3>

<p>The IEM maintains two directly web-accessible trees of archived weather
products.  This page provides a crude schema of what products are archived and
where within the directory tree you can find them.  The reason there are
two archives is that the products have different funding / support resources
and legacy.</p>

<p>The products are generally organized by UTC date, but some of the products
found are for the local/Iowa calendar date.</p>
