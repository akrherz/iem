<p><strong>Iowa's Earliest Snowfall on Record</strong>
<br />There is no one exact or official answer to this question.  In
the modern era, September 25th 1942 could be considered as the earliest 
date in the fall of accumulating snowfall. Up to 4 inches fell 
that day with nearly all of the state seeing something.

<br />&nbsp;<br />However, there was an earlier event back on September 16, 1881 when snow
accumulated over about the western one-half of Iowa and 4 to 6 inches was
reported between Avoca and Stuart in west central Iowa.

<br />&nbsp;<br />There were reports of a few flakes on September 6, 1929 
near Alton about 9 a.m.
