</ol>

<p>This page allows you to download observed, sometimes quality controlled, 
 and sometimes estimated once daily reports from the NWS COOP network.  Please be
 sure to understand these caveats before using the data:
<ul>
	<li>In general, the snowfall data is mostly there.  
	Some years are missing data.  Estimating snowfall is very difficult and
	even the reports of snowfall are questionable.  The same applies for
	snow depth.</li>
	<li>If you are looking to download the entire dataset, please check 
	out <a href="/pickup/coop_data/">this directory!</a></li>
	<li>If you find errors in the dataset, please let us know!  There are 
 numerous folks working on the data quality of this important dataset 
 and we are always interested in feedback.</li>
    <li>The dates presented are the day on which the observation was reported.
    The values represent a 24 hour period prior to that observation.  Unfortunately,
    presenting the time of the observation is not supported yet.  To complicate 
    things, some of the data is actually on the local calendar day.</li>
    <li>On this page, you will also find 'stations' called "Average" or 
    "Climate Division".  These virtual stations represent an areal average over
    a given state or standard climate district.</li>
    <li>You will find download options for daily solar radiation data.  Of course,
    this variable is not observed by this network but is included as a convience.
    These values were derived from various modelling efforts. This data 
    represents a local calendar day.  Only the 
    <a href="http://ruc.noaa.gov/hrrr/">HRRR</a> estimates have data for
    recent days, it takes a few months for 
    <a href="http://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/">MERRA-2</a> and 
    <a href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.narr.html">NARR</a>
    estimates to appear.
    These values are obtained by simple grid point sampling.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>If you are looking for actual observations with no estimating and very little
 quality control done, check out <a href="obs-fe.phtml">this page</a>.

<p>The quality controlled data <strong>for Iowa</strong> is currently updated 
 to {$enddate}.  While data is available for dates up 
 until yesterday, the values are estimated by the IEM.  The quality controlled
 data is provided to us by the Iowa State Climatology.  News items are posted
 to the <a href="/">homepage</a> when a month's worth of data is sent to us.</p>

<p>Data is also available from the following states: 
<a href="fe.phtml?network=ILCLIMATE">Illinois</a> ,
<a href="fe.phtml?network=INCLIMATE">Indiana</a> ,
<a href="fe.phtml?network=IACLIMATE">Iowa</a> ,
<a href="fe.phtml?network=KSCLIMATE">Kansas</a>,
<a href="fe.phtml?network=KYCLIMATE">Kentucky</a> ,
<a href="fe.phtml?network=MICLIMATE">Michigan</a> ,
<a href="fe.phtml?network=MNCLIMATE">Minnesota</a> ,
<a href="fe.phtml?network=MOCLIMATE">Missouri</a> ,
<a href="fe.phtml?network=NECLIMATE">Nebraska</a> ,
<a href="fe.phtml?network=OHCLIMATE">Ohio</a> ,
<a href="fe.phtml?network=NDCLIMATE">North Dakota</a> ,
<a href="fe.phtml?network=SDCLIMATE">South Dakota</a> ,
<a href="fe.phtml?network=WICLIMATE">Wisconsin</a>.  This information is mostly
estimated until <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov">NCDC</a> provides updated 
GHCN datafiles, which the IEM then merges into this dataset.  The unfortunate
side effect is that data changes as new information becomes available.

<p>If you really need calendar day data and other variables like
 wind speed and relative humidity, check out the <a href="/iemre/">IEM Reanalysis</a>
 effort. 

<div class="alert alert-warning">The purpose is to provide a dataset that does 
 not have holes in it for temperature and precipitation and is updated up 
 until yesterday.  Unfortunately, these
 values are not on a local calendar day, so please be very careful before
 use.  Unfortunately, long term observations that are on local calendar 
 days does not exist!</div>
