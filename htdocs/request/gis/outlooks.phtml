<p>The IEM attempts to process and archive the convective and fire weather
outlooks issued by the Storm Prediction Center and the excessive rainfall 
outlooks issued by the Weather Prediction Center. This processing is done by
parsing the PTS product via <a href="https://github.com/akrherz/pyIEM/blob/main/src/pyiem/nws/products/spcpts.py">pyIEM decoder</a>. 
Recently, the SPC website has added direct single outlook downloads in various
GIS formats. 
<strong>Your best data quality will come from scraping their website</strong>, but
maybe that approach is not for all users of this data! So here it is, a means
to bulk download the IEM's SPC/WPC Outlook database.</p>

<p><a href="/cgi-bin/request/gis/spc_outlooks.py?help" class="btn btn-default">
<i class="fa fa-file"></i> Backend documentation</a> exists for those wishing to
script against this service.</p>

<h4>Archive / Usage Notes:</h4>
<ol>
 <li><strong>11 Jul 2023:</strong> The archive was reprocessed to allow for
 specification of returned geometries in either "cake layer" or "cookie cutter"
 form.  This gets complex to explain, but hopefully as a simple example: If you
 are under a "Moderate Risk", the cake layer form would include polygons with
 thresholds of general thunderstorm, marginal, slight, and enhanced for your
 location: the cookie cutter form would just have a moderate polygon covering
 your location.</li>
 <li><strong>1 Apr 2021:</strong> An assessment was made of the archive
 completeness and found 99.9% coverage.  Some of the holes are due to
 lost PTS text products yet to be found and others are due to errors within
 the PTS product causing it to be generally unusable.</li>
 <li>A complication with using this dataset is that all outlooks are returned, the
 <code>CYCLE</code> attribute attempts to define a canonical outlook for a given
 issuance cycle.  For example, the Day 1 20Z convective outlook may get issued three
 times for various reasons.  The download contains all three, but two of them will
 have a cycle of `-1` and the other will have a `20`.</li>
 <li>Presently, the service only returns outlooks that had actual geographies
 associated with the outlook.  For example, if there was no Day 5 area in the
 outlook, no entries are included in the download result.</li>
