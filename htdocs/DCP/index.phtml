<h3>GOES DCP</h3>

<p>The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites 
(GOES) Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) are a set of hydrologic and meteorologic
data collection points.  The DCPs are a collection of networks owned and operated 
by a host of entities. [<b>1</b>]  The IEM receives this dataset from our 
<a href="https://www.unidata.ucar.edu">Unidata</a> 
feed, which contains the products produced by the Office of Dissemination
of the National Weather Service.<p>

<p>The NWS has a fantastic 
<a href="https://hads.ncep.noaa.gov">website</a> if you are curious 
about this dataset.</p>

<p>The IEM attempts to process all available data in this feed.  The applications
 below are divided up by states, so switch the state shown to find data outside of 
 Iowa. </p>
