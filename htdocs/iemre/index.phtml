<p>IEM Reanalysis is an effort to provide a regular 
dataset of Iowa Environmental Data without many of the problems associated
with single site observations.  The IEM will continue to provide single
site observational data, but for some purposes, this dataset will be easier
to work with.  <strong>No dataset is perfect and this dataset is provided
without warranty.</strong></p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Why do this?</strong>
 <br />Previously, the IEM has only provided raw observations with limited
quality control checks in place.  Quality control is hard!  Many times, users
are simply looking for something "close" and perhaps not as perfect as high
quality sensor observations can be.  Producing a gridded analysis is one
way to produce a dataset from point observations which can be sampled as
a means of spatial interpolation.</li>

 <li><strong>Isn't this a duplication of effort?</strong>
 <br />While there are other "reanalysis" type projects out there with
data freely available, many times their data does not update in near real-time
and does not include many of the datasets the IEM uniquely collects. We may
also produce an analysis on sub-hourly timescales.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data Flow</h3>
 
<div class="row">
 	<div class="col-md-4">
	<h4>1. Input Datasets</h4>
 	<ul>
 		<li><strong>NCEP Stage IV Precipitation</strong>
 		<br />This is an hourly gridded product with precipitation estimates
 		derived by RADAR and then bias corrected by gauge data. The IEM
 		caches the <a href="{$s4link}">grib data</a> and makes hourly
 		plots available <a href="/timemachine/#40.0">here</a>.</li>
 		
 		<li><strong>MRMS Precipitation</strong>
 		<br />Currently, this is only used to populate a daily total in a
 		dedicated netcdf file.</li>

 		<li>ASOS/AWOS Daily Summaries</li>
 		<li>NWS Daily Climate Summaries</li>
 		<li>HRRR/MERRA/NARR Daily Solar Radiation</li>
 		<li>NWS COOPerative Observations</li>
 		<li>Manually QC'd Iowa COOP data from Iowa's State Climatologist</li>
 		<li>NCDC QC'd COOP Data</li>

 	<div class="col-md-4">
	<h4>2. IEM ReAnalysis Gridded Datasets</h4>
 	<ul>
 		<li><a href="/plotting/auto/?q=86">Daily Maps of Gridded Variables</a>
 		<br />View a smoothed or gridded plot of IEMRE data</li>

 	</ul>
 	</div>
 	<div class="col-md-4">
	<h4>3. Climodat Station Data</h4>
	<p>The location of the IEM Longterm tracked climate stations are used to
 		sample from the IEMRE grid to produce daily values of high / low
 		temperature, precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, and radiation.  For
 		some stations, a direct copy of the corresponding ASOS station data
 		is used.</p>
 	<ul>
 		<li><a href="/climodat/">Climodat Reports</a>
 		<br />These are pre-generated reports answering many of the commonly
 		asked climatology questions.</li>
