<h3>IEM Reanalysis (IEMRE)</h3><p>

<p>IEM Reanalysis is an effort to provide a regular 
dataset of Iowa Environmental Data without many of the problems associated
with single site observations.  The IEM will continue to provide single
site observational data, but for some purposes, this dataset will be easier
to work with.  <strong>No dataset is perfect and this dataset is provided
without warranty.</strong></p>

<div class="alert alert-info">
 <strong>Use better products!</strong>
 <br />The IEM Reanalysis is nothing special. It was cool maybe 15 years ago,
 but now days there are superior products available.  Use those instead!
</div>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Why do this?</strong>
 <br />Previously, the IEM has only provided raw observations with limited
quality control checks in place.  Quality control is hard!  Many times, users
are simply looking for something "close" and perhaps not as perfect as high
quality sensor observations can be.  Producing a gridded analysis is one
way to produce a dataset from point observations which can be sampled as
a means of spatial interpolation.</li>

 <li><strong>Isn't this a duplication of effort?</strong>
 <br />While there are other "reanalysis" type projects out there with
data freely available, many times their data does not update in near real-time
and does not include many of the datasets the IEM uniquely collects.
<br />Having said that, here are some alternatives:
<br /><a href="https://www.ecmwf.int/en/era5-land">ERA5Land</a>
<br /><a href="https://daymet.ornl.gov/">DayMet</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.climatologylab.org/gridmet.html">GridMet</a>
<br /><a href="https://prism.oregonstate.edu/">PRISM</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Product Changes</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>4 Jan 2023:</strong> Near realtime solar radiation is sourced from
the HRRR model.  For dates prior to 8 days ago, it is sourced from ERA5Land.
This is a change as it used to be sourced from MERRAv2.  It will take
a number of days to update the archive to use this new source.</li>
<li><strong>1 May 2018:</strong> Grid domain expanded to cover CONUS.  It will
take a while to fully populate the grids.  At the moment, just the previous
midwestern US data is available.  Grid resolution increased to 0.125x0.125
degree.</li>

    <h4>1. Input Datasets</h4>
     <ul>
         <li><strong>NCEP Stage IV Precipitation</strong>
         <br />This is an hourly gridded product with precipitation estimates
         derived by RADAR and then bias corrected by gauge data. The IEM
         caches the <a href="{$s4link}">grib data</a> and makes hourly
         plots available <a href="/timemachine/#40.0">here</a>.</li>
         
         <li><strong>MRMS Precipitation</strong>
         <br />Currently, this is only used to populate a daily total in a
         dedicated netcdf file.</li>

    <p>The location of the IEM Longterm tracked climate stations are used to
         sample from the IEMRE grid to produce daily values of high / low
         temperature, precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, and radiation.  For
         some stations, a direct copy of the corresponding ASOS station data
         is used.</p>

<h3>Hourly Data Sources</h3>

<p>Yearly <a href="/onsite/iemre/">netcdf files</a> since 1950, with updates
at about 10 after the hour.  Since we want real-time data, some of these
model sources are not available immediately, so the denoted intermediate source
fills the gap until the final source is available.</p>

<h3>Daily Data Sources</h3>

<p>Yearly <a href="/onsite/iemre/">netcdf files</a> since 1893. Some of these
variables are directly sourced from the hourly grids above.  The concept of
a daily variable is a bit nebulous, but is intended to be a 6 to 6 UTC period.
