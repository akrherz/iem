<h2>IEM Representivity Analysis</h2>

<h4>Daryl Herzmann and Jeff Wolt
<br />Department of Agronomy, Iowa State University</h4>

<p>The scale of representivity of a sampling network determines the area 
and time over which a measurement represents true conditions. This 
document provides information and statistics regarding the spatial
representativity of the Iowa Environmental Mesonet (IEM)
following methodology described by Dubois (2000).

<h3><a name="introduction">1. Introduction:</a></h3>

<p>The IEM is a collection of environmental monitoring networks that have
been linked to produce a more precise analysis of weather and 
climatic variables in the state than can be achieved with any single network.
To produce higher resolution products for
the entire state, point observations are often gridded onto a regular grid
using well known algorithms like nearest neighbor or a weighting function.  
This 
process is not arbitrary due to the numerous tunable parameters to most any
analysis algorithm.  It is important to investigate the characteristics of
the Iowa Environmental Mesonet to determine the appropriate scales at 
which phenomena can be accurately analyzed.

<p>Since the IEM is a collection of networks, each one is evaluated on its own.
Groups of similar networks in data quality are then aggregated
to explore the spatial statistical benefits of the IEM partnership.

<tr><th>ASOS</th><td>The <a href="/ASOS/">Automated Surface Observing System</a> sites are located at primary airports and are maintained by the National Weather Service.  This network is rigorously checked and
 quality controlled.  For Iowa, a limitation of the ASOS network is the 
lack of sites located in Westcentral and Southwest Iowa.</td><td><img src="nni_images/asos_locs.png"></tr>

<tr><th>AWOS</th><td>The <a href="/AWOS/">Automated Weather Observing System</a> sites are located at secondary airports and 
are maintained by state government entities via third 
party contractors.  Data quality should be comparable with the ASOS network
since they are using similar instrumentation, but a number of factors 
produce biases when compared with the ASOS network.  The main issues include 
siting, maintenance schedules, and network communication.  Most of the significant  
differences between the ASOS and AWOS network show up in the temperature 
and dew point measurements due to siting. </td><td><img src="nni_images/awos_locs.png"></tr>

<tr><th>RWIS</th><td>The <a href="/RWIS/">Roadway Weather Information System</a> sites are located along side interstates and highways.  They are maintained by their respective state department of transportation via a 
third party contractor.  Atmospheric data from this network is of lesser 
quality than the ASOS or AWOS networks.  The primary purpose of the RWIS network is for automated observation of winter weather. The IEM collects RWIS data
from Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Nebraska, and Kansas.  Other states may have
RWIS networks, but often their data is proprietary.</td><td><img src="nni_images/rwis_locs.png"></td></tr>

<tr><th>SchoolNet</th><td>The IEM collects data from a number of <a href="/schoolnet/">SchoolNets</a>.  The IEM collects data from three
SchoolNet data networks operated by KCCI-TV, KIMT-TV, and KELO-TV.  Data 
quality is close to that of the RWIS network, but siting issues make 
measurements like wind and precipitation problematic. </td><td><img src="nni_images/snet_locs.png"></td></tr>

<tr><th>ISUAG</th><td>The <a href="/agclimate/">ISU Ag Climate</a> sites primarily provide soil temperature and solar radiation readings.
They are maintained by the Iowa State University Experiment Station.  The main issue with this network is the timing of observations received.  Each station is called daily to download its observation record from the previous day. </td><td><img src="nni_images/isuag_locs.png"></td></tr>

<h3><a name="nearest">2. Nearest Neighbors Index (NNI)</a></h3>

<p>The NNI is a statistic comparing the mean minimum distances between sampling points to those that are expected by chance over some sampling area.

<h4>Procedure:</h4>

<p>Point shapefile coverages for each of the network groups were created.  These files were loaded into ESRI's ArcGIS 9.1 software.  An ArcGIS extension named
 <a href="http://arcscripts.esri.com/details.asp?dbid=12227"><i>Nearest Neighbor Analysis / Event-Event Distances</i></a> written by Dr M. Sawada was used to compute the NNI.

<p>Table 3 presents the results of the NNI computation.  Also presented are
the Z statistic, average minimum distance between two sites and expected minimum distance
based on a homogeneous in space distribution of sites.

<h4>Analysis:</h4>

<table cellpadding=2 cellspacing=0 border=1>
<caption>Table 4: NNI interpretation</caption>
<thead>
<tr><th>NNI Value</th><th>Details</th></tr>
</thead>
<tr><td>&gt; 1</td><td>increasing values greater than 1 indicate more dispersion</td></tr>
<tr><td>= 1</td><td>indicates sampling points have a uniform distribution</td></tr>
<tr><td> &lt; 1</td><td>decreasing values less than 1 indicate more clustering</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Table 3 shows the results of the NNI computation. For NNI, the closest 
value to unity (which is desired for this statistic) is the ASOS network. 
This implies that the ASOS network is representative at the expected minimum
distance of 36.5 km.  For the most part, the AWOS and RWIS networks have 
values close to unity as well.  The SchoolNet and ISUAG values well below 
unity indicate clustering.  When the networks are grouped together, Tier 1
has the closest values to unity.  The addition of more clustered networks in
Tier 2 and Tier 3 negatively impact the NNI statistics.

<p>The Z statistic is also presented in Table 3.   If the NNI statistic 
indicates dispersion or clustering, the Z statistic tests to see if the
difference of NNI from unity (randomness) is significant (Clark 1954).  
Values above 1.96 or below -1.96 indicate a 95% confidence that the 
distribution is <b>not</b> randomly distributed.   The only networks within
this desired range are the ASOS, RWIS, and ISUAG networks.  The large value
of 5.54 for the SchoolNet clearly indicates the clustering of this network
given our domain of interest.  It is interesting to note that all three
"tiers" of networks have rather large Z values.  This can be explained by
considering that many cities (spatially confined area) have a station from 
a couple of the networks.  Thus the combination of networks into tiers 
produces some clustering.

<h3><a name="fractal">3.  Fractal Dimension</a></h3>

<p>The fractal dimension (D<sub>m</sub>) is used to characterize the distribution of a 
geophysical data array (Lovejoy 1986).   An uniform distribution of 
elements on the surface of the Earth will have a fractal dimension of 2.
All other distributions should have a value between 0 and 2, with the degree
of inhomogeneity being measured by 2 - D<sub>m</sub>.

<p>The correlation dimension (D<sub>c</sub>) is often used as an approximation
to the fractal dimension since it is easier to compute.  To compute 
(D<sub>c</sub>), rings of increasing radius are formed around each member of
the observing network.  The number of stations are then counted within each
of these rings and then averaged for rings of the same radius.  The result is
an average station frequency at various distances.

<p>Doswell and Lasher-Trapp (1997) point out two problems with the 
computation of the correlation dimension.  The first is the problem of 
considering stations located near the edge of the observing network.  These
stations will only have a majority of their neighbors to one preferred 
direction.  Data from these stations will bias the computation.  The other
issue is the arbitrary nature of actually computing the correlation
dimension which involves computing the slope of a line comparing the
natural log of the station count versus the natural log of station frequency.
This slope of this line, thus the correlation dimension, is often not 
consistent throughout the range of data.  Two parts of the curve may appear
to be very linear, but their slopes will often be much different.

<h4>Procedure</h4>

<p>A python script was written to compute the needed variables for the 
correlation dimension statistic.  The spatial computations were done in 
the PostGIS database using the NAD83 UTM Zone15 North projection.

<h4>Analysis</h4>

<p>The issues pointed out in Doswell (1997) are evident in this analysis.
  The arbitrary selection of points used in the linear regression 
yield results that may not be accurate for the entire range of scales 
represented.  Ideally, values should not exceed 2 with 2 being an uniform
distribution in 2 dimensions.  In both ranges, values decrease with the 
inclusion of Tier 1, 2, and 3 collections.  The reason for this is the 
increased bias introduced by edge effects as the center of the domain becomes
more densely populated and the exterior portions of the state (namely Northeast
and Southern Iowa) become comparatively less. 

<h3><a name="morisita">4. Morisita Index</a></h3>

<p>The Morisita index investigates how much clustering occurs when a sampling
network is broken up into regular cells. If each cell has the same number of
observation points inside of it, then the index should indicate uniformity in
space at that scale. The equation is as follows:

<p>
<div class="equation">
<img src="nni_images/morisita_eqn.png">
<span>where Q is the total number of cells, 
n<sub>i</sub> is the number of samples in i<sup>th</sup> cell, and N is the
total number of sampling points.</span> 
</div>

<br clear="all" />

<h4>Procedure:</h4>

<p>A python script was written to compute this value.  The spatial computations were
done in NAD83 UTM Zone 15N, which is a common projection for Iowa.  

<p>Figures 2 illustrates the procedure for computing the Morisita index for
a hypothetical network.  
Within an area of interest, there is a distribution of observation 
points (left side graphic).  The area of interest is divided up into 
equal sized cells; the number of cells  with sites in them 
(right side graphic) represents the contributing members to the Morisita index.

<div class="figure">
<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="1">
<thead>

    <td><img src="nni_images/morisita_2.png" border="2"></td>
</tr></table>
<br />Figure 2:  Illustration of Morisita Index
</div>

<p>In this example, the Morisita index is around 13.  This is a very high
number and indicates clustering.  This procedure is iterated over
a range of grid cell sizes to arrive at a better understanding 
of how the clustering varies at different scales.

<p>Figure 3 indicates the scales at which clustering (values larger than 1) 
is ocurring.  At the smallest scales of 10-40 km, clustering is evident in
the Tier 2 and Tier 3 networks.  This makes practical sense considering 
the co-placement of RWIS sites near cities with ASOS/AWOS sites in Tier 2 and
the overall clustering of SchoolNet sites in Tier 3.  The general clustering
of Schoolnet sites is very evident with values well above unity.


<h3><a name="thiessen">5. Thiessen/Voronoi polygons</a></h3>

<p>Thiessen polygons have been a traditional staple of the spatial 
statistician. Each constructed polygon contains exactly one measurement 
point while having the property of all points within the polygon being 
closer to this measurement point than any 
other point.  Isolated measurements will therefore have larger polygons than
clustered measurements.  Histograms of the area covered by these polygons 
provide insight into network homogeneity.

<h4>Procedure:</h4>

<p>The point coverage shapefiles were loaded into ArcGIS 9.1.  The ArcInfo 
Thiessen polygon tool was then used to generate the polygons.  These 
polygons were then clipped by the border of Iowa within ArcGIS as well.  
The resulting coverage was exported to shapefile and then loaded into the 
IEM's spatial database for analysis.

<h4>Data:</h4>
<div class="figure">
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1">
<thead><tr><th colspan="2">Figure 4: Tier 1</th></tr></thead>

<thead><tr><th colspan="2">Figure 6: Tier 3</th></tr></thead>
<tr><td><img src="nni_images/tier3_areas.png"></td><td><img src="nni_images/tier3_th.png"></td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<h4>Analysis:</h4>

<p>Thiessen polygons provide a quick synopsis of how large of an area is 
represented by a single point.  Areas in a network that are under sampled can
quickly be seen, since large anonolous polygons will visually stick out.

<p>Figure 4 shows the histogram and Thiessen Polygons for Tier 1.  The 
undersampled areas of Northern Missouri, Northeastern Kansas, and South 
Dakota are clearly seen by their comparatively large polygons.  The histogram
illustrates this difference with a large clustering of smaller polygons and 
then numerous large ones outside of Iowa.

<p>The addition of the RWIS networks in Tier 2, shown in Figure 5, almost
exasperates the situation.  The lack of RWIS sites in Missouri and South Dakota
don't help shrink the size of the polygons in those areas.  The result can 
be seen in the histogram with the general trend of smaller polygons, but still
possessing some very large ones as well.

<p>For Tier 3, the clustering of sites in Central Iowa with the SchoolNet 
network creates a large number of smaller polygons and doesn't help to eliminate
the larger polygons in Missouri and Illinois.  The histogram shows a mode 
around 500 km^2 with around 15% of the polygons at least 7 times larger.  The 
conclusion is that for the <b>entire domain</b>, the addition of other networks
is only beneficial when those networks have stations in each state used for 
this analysis.


<h3><a name="represent">6. Coefficient of Representativity</a></h3>

<p>The Coefficient of Representativity (CR) was proposed by Dubois (2000) as a
measure to combine the Thiessen polygons and the distance to the nearest
neighbor.  

<p>
<div class="equation">
<img src="nni_images/cr_eqn.png">
<span>The CR is a product of two terms, the first (A) is a simple ratio of 
the area of the Thiessen polygon (S<sub>Th</sub>) to the mean 
Thiessen polygon (S<sub>m</sub>): total area divided by number of 
sampling points); the second (B) is a ratio between the 
squared distance between nearest neighbors and the same mean Thiessen polygon.</span>
</div>

<h4>Procedure:</h4>

<p>Thiessen polygons and network coverages were loaded into the IEM spatial
database.  Python scripts were then written to analyze distances and compute
other parameters needed for the CR.

<p>Tier 1 clearly shows the lack of observing sensors in Missouri, Nebraska,
and South Dakota.  Ideally, the "white" color would dominate the map
indicating areas of uniform representativity.  The analysis shows that perhaps
only portions of Northcentral Iowa are representatively measured by sensors
in Tier 1.

<p>It is interesting to note the dark blotches that appear in Figure 8 for 
Tier 2.  The dark blues represent clustering and those are locations where
a RWIS site is located close to one or more ASOS/AWOS sites.  The overall
impact of adding RWIS sites is to increase the sparsity in states where the
IEM doesn't collect RWIS data.

<p>The addition of SchoolNet data in Tier 3 only makes the contrast more
distinct.  It is interesting to note the strong gradient of CR along the 
Iowa/Missouri border.  This is a result of a dearth of observations in 
Northern Missouri.

<h3><a name="conclusions">7. Conclusions</a></h3>

<p>To evaluate the spatial representativity of the Iowa Environmental Mesonet
(IEM),
five spatial statistics were computed following the work done by Dubois (2000).
While each statistic showed some positive aspects of the Mesonet collaboration,
they clearly point out the need for caution before blindly combining all 
available data into a high resolution product.

<p>The CR figures most clearly illustrate the difficulties of adding stations
from other networks and their localized impact on the overall analysis.  It
is particularly dangerous to add networks that are not uniformly distributed
across our domain of interest. The easy solution would be to add stations
in those areas to 'fill in the holes'.  Up until this study, 
the IEM has focused on adding other networks to fill in these holes without 
realizing the implications of additional clustering in areas like Central and 
Eastern Iowa.  This "catch-22" can clearly be seen in Figure 8 for Tier 2 when
the RWIS sites, which are often located near the same towns as ASOS/AWOS sites, 
are added.  The addition of nearly 70 SchoolNet sites in Central Iowa only 
further exasperates the situation with under sampled areas showing up over the
rest of the state as shown in Figure 9.

<p>Clearly, this study points out the need for a disciplined approach before
adding networks in an ad-hoc manner to produce an analysis.  Perhaps 
non-standard networks included in Tier 2 and Tier 3 can be subsampled to 
selectively augment undersampled areas as shown in Figure 7.  There will 
always be trade offs when working with combining network and data.  It is 
important that one of these trade offs is not degradation in data quality.
