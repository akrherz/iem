 - The regional interest this year is IA, IL and IN
 - [ ] investigate NASA Power and see how difference its radiation is
 - There are three deliverables they want
 - [ ] Static 1980-2018 PSIMs files, like I generated last year
 - [ ] four routinely updated PSIMs files, one for each CFS 9 mon realization
 - [ ] scenarios with all years substituted.  This may be too much data for
       them, so lower priority for now.

 5 Jan 2017 Dr Archontoulis
 - Review Nov 1 to today plot, to ensure it is doing the right thing
 - [ ] remove the march 15 to today plot, not used
 - [ ] Add NASS county yield somehow to the arridity x/y plot
 - A new folder was created at dropbox for the uploads to go to

11 Apr 2016 Dr Archontoulis
 - He now has 6 files processed up until 23 March, wants data till 30 Nov
 - March 15th start date for the various GDD, etc plots
 - For the future scatter, just make it a cloud with some lines in it
 - Would like to use dropbox for sharing files
 - Add a GDD column and others for the APSIM met file
 - FIX: the units of the soil moisture shown in the download page
 - Will want me to produce a differently formatted file later in July
 - He wants 4 days of forecast data
 - Output file name is Ames_YYYYmmdd.met

24 Mar 2016 Dr Archontoulis
 - Discuss my involvement with the yield forecasting project
 - Dr Helmers Cobbs site will be sending hourly precip data my way
 - They have a good web developer, so I am just wrangling data
 - I need to look at a dataset called agmerra
 - So the complicated routine about producing a 1980-2015 weather data file
 that has this year's data + forecast replacing that year's period.  Then the
 rest of the year is simply taking that old year's data.  I'll automate this
 - Look into usage of GFS + CFS for forecast data
 - There are six sites in play
