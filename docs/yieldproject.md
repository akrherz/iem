 - Add a GDD column and others for the APSIM met file
 - FIX: the units of the soil moisture shown in the download page
 - Will want me to produce a differently formatted file later in July

 - Discuss my involvement with the yield forecasting project
 - Dr Helmers Cobbs site will be sending hourly precip data my way
 - They have a good web developer, so I am just wrangling data
 - I need to look at a dataset called agmerra
 - So the complicated routine about producing a 1980-2015 weather data file
 that has this year's data + forecast replacing that year's period.  Then the
 rest of the year is simply taking that old year's data.  I'll automate this
 - Look into usage of GFS + CFS for forecast data
 - There are six sites in play
