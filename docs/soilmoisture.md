  - Discussion of the new vineyard stations and likely not to include them at
    this time
  - I raised the need for 5-15 minute data and was wondering about the cell
    phone bill and if it could support more frequent data
  - Need to look into a legal aggreement with the private farm weather stations
    as the lat/lons are published for them
  - Need to decide if bare soil would be maintained for sites for the 4 inch
    sensor.
  - Need coefficients for each site so to get accurate soil moisture data
  - perhaps the soil moisture data should be removed from the website until
    this issue is resolved...
  - [ ] daryl should implement a replacement of the winter time precip so to
    allow for more complete data
  - [ ] change the alerting threshold for offline alerts as they are being
    ignored by others
  - Ethan is funded 100% now from Experiment Station, so can work on this
  - [ ] create electronic version of the checklist for stations to do
  - Email Tim and Ethan on issues at the same time.
