  - Lots of discussion on the 5 vineyard stations, some highlights
   - currently in boxes, purchased in June
   - would like to spread them out over the state
   - have leaf wetness sensors
   - They will likely not be under bare soil
   - discussion on how these stations can be used for frost protection(?), this
     was not fully clear to me, but it would involve some aux forecast data
   - the soils are high pH, but not necessily sandy
   - they have the same cell modems
   - still have to resolve where they are putting soil moisture sensors
  - [x] email Flory and gauge interest on this matter
  - discussion of placing a new sensor on a farm of interest NE of Ames
  - is the new station at Marcus too close to others?

  - Dr Honeyman has a draft agreement that was worked on with legal council
    for the sites that are on private farms
  - Dr Taylor expressed a need to start replacing the wind sensors soon
  - He has a spot in mind (Marcus, IA) for the current unused station
  - Discussion about how soil moisture calibration is done in Oklahoma and
    how we could apply it here
    - They take two samples down to 5ft and then do gravimetric
  - Dr Taylor believes that we don't need per-site logger program calibrations
    of the sensors, errors are within 2%
  - Flory is going to look into multiplexors
  - [ ] daryl's TODO item on replacing winter precip was discussed again
  - Voted to have a bare soil requirement, Dr Honeyman will email out the group
  - We can likely increase the reporting interval as the timing and bandwidth
    exists
  - The door was opened again for having the Hort/Vineyard stations join the
    network
  - Discussion on what the Iowa Flood Center is deploying for soil moisture
    stations.

  - Discussion of the new vineyard stations and likely not to include them at
    this time
  - I raised the need for 5-15 minute data and was wondering about the cell
    phone bill and if it could support more frequent data
  - Need to look into a legal aggreement with the private farm weather stations
    as the lat/lons are published for them
  - Need to decide if bare soil would be maintained for sites for the 4 inch
    sensor.
  - Need coefficients for each site so to get accurate soil moisture data
  - perhaps the soil moisture data should be removed from the website until
    this issue is resolved...
  - [ ] daryl should implement a replacement of the winter time precip so to
    allow for more complete data
  - [x] change the alerting threshold for offline alerts as they are being
    ignored by others
  - Ethan is funded 100% now from Experiment Station, so can work on this
  - [ ] create electronic version of the checklist for stations to do
  - Email Tim and Ethan on issues at the same time.
