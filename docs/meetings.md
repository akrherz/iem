29 Mar 2016 Syngenta Discussion at Slater
 Joe Colleti, Bill Bevis, Kendall Lamkey, Joe Byrun, Greg Dudan, Homer Coden
 Josh Larson, Paul Travis, Danny Sign, Jim Reece, Tom Warner, Chad Geater
 Craig Davis, Mike Lorsan, Caroline Lawrence, James Coyle
 - Conference calls left off with need to resolve access and mechanics of how
   this would work out.
 - Syngenta has roughtly relationships with 15-20 Universities per 12-18 months
 - Never known transfer of actual data to another university though
 - Discussion about what the NSF funded midwest data hub looks like
 - It has 8 spokes, one of which is digitial Ag, another is Food, Energy, Water
 - The hub has the hope of collaborating with industry partners
 - the hub is a blanket umbrella for other projects to get funded with
 - The IP rights of such a collaboration are not necessarily defaulted to ISU
 - The hope is to get the lawyers to approve of this activity only once
 - There are two proposals in consideration as a part of the data hub spoke
 - USDA has a new foundation called FAR to fund stuff
 - NSF proposal cycle has deadlines for next Jan, Feb
 - the hope is that these proposals would be coming from blessing by the hub
   spokes and not rouge proposals
 - There are always proposal deadlines for things to consider
 - There are collaboration opportunities withe computer engineering and others
   to deal with computational tasks
 - Need to have a means to lure faculty into this that may have an interest
 - Syngenta has interest in persuing external funding
 - We'll be having breakouts today to further discuss things
 - I went to the Environmental Data Group with Joe Colleti and Chad Geater
   - Field weather stations have standard variables
   - They use gridded 0.25 degree data from the ECMWF (proprietary)
   - need to tease out drought tolerance variables from obs
   - unsure what exists for soybean data
   - a recent push was to push for GPS coordinates on all their data
   - Unsure what management data exists
   - they may have some soil temperature data
   - an issue is finding agreement between environmental datasets
 - Data needed depends on the science, or is it vice versa
 - A key aspect is where the compute runs that has to access the data
 - Likely can not determine logistics today
 - Not all of their data is relational, in fact, likely not even a majority
 - What is the quality of metadata?
 - They are working on data tagging.
 - Some of the datasets have changes in how the data was observed over the years
 - Would it be good to embed people within each institution to help with this
   collaboration?
 - A vast majority of the data would take effort to move and curate, not ready
 - Lots of data already exists, no energy to start processing it
 - Cateloging the data is a big time sync
 - talk about a project called G2F taking field measurements
 - G2F is having good luck with standardizing protocols
 - Need to make sure questions being posed are not redundant between groups
 - There is a some NSF data hub meeting on May 15-16
 - Do ISU corn and soybean faculty currently collaborate?  Sort of.
 - Not everybody at ISU is into team science :)
 - Talk about the structure of an ISU / Syngenta symposium
