"""
This plot attempts to show the impact of cloudiness
on temperatures.  The plot shows a simple difference between the average
temperature during cloudy/mostly cloudy conditions and the average
temperature by hour and by week of the year.  The input data for this
chart is limited to post 1973 as cloud cover data since then is more
reliable/comparable.
