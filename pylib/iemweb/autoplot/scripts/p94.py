"""
This plot looks at the effect of splitting a 24
hour period at different hours of the day.  Using the hourly temperature
record, we can look at the bias of computing the daily high and low
temperature.  Confusing?  Assuming that the 'truth' is a daily high and
low computed at midnight, we can compare this value against 24 hour periods
computed for each hour of the day. This plot is one of the main reasons
that comparing climate data for a station that changed hour of day
observation over the years is problematic.
